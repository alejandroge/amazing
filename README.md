This source code provides a refactoring challenge.  Beginning with either Amazing.java or amazing.rb, and using the tests as support, refactor the code until there are no code smells remaining.

The original challenge is by Alan Hensel and can be read here: http://www.mindspring.com/~alanh/refactoring/challenge.html. Bill Wake also converted the challenge to Java. All other language variants here are by me.

Please feel free to contribute ports of this code to other languages.
